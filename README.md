# Swing Connect Four
This is a simple connect four game written in Java.

# Installation
- Note: Source files along with resource files
  must be in their original location.
- Note: The main class is 'ConnectFour'.
The program can be launched by:
- Running the ConnectFour class in an IDE capable of running  Java.
- Manually compiling and running the source files:
    javac <path to package>/connectfour/*.java
    java connectfour.ConnectFour

# Usage
For help on how to use the software, refer to the help section in the software.
This program saves to three files, 'save.connect4', 'p1.color', 'p2.color'.
Tampering or moving the save files is not recommended, but if done, the program
will still remain fully operational, simply without the ability to save and loads games.
Colors will return to defaults as well.
