For help on how to use the software, refer to the help section in the software.
This program saves to three files, 'save.connect4', 'p1.color', 'p2.color'.
Tampering or moving the save files is not recommended, but if done, the program
will still remain fully operational, simply without the ability to save and loads games.
Colors will return to defaults as well.
