    The objective is to connect four of your colored checker pieces in a row, much the same as tic tac toe. This can be
    done horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Each player will drop in one checker piece at a time. This will give
    you a chance to either build your row, or block your opponent from getting four in a row. The game is over either
    when you or your friend reaches four in a row, or when all forty two slots are filled, ending in a stalemate.

    Use the mouse to select the column you wish to place your piece in. You can click anywhere in the column, as the
    piece will just land in the next available slot in that column, regardless of where you clicked within the
    column. When a player has won, the winning pieces will be shown and a dialog box announcing the winner will show
    up, resetting the game once you close it.

    The game also has save and load functions triggered by using <i>CTRL+S</i> (save) and <i>CTRL+L</i> (load).
    It is also possible to reset the game by using <i>CTRL+R</i> (reset). To change the piece colours, simply open
    the color changer from the options menu or press <i>CTRL+C</i>. Select the colour of your choice, then hit the
    'Change color for player one' button or 'Change color for player two'. To restore the default colours (red & yellow),
    press the 'Restore default colors' button in the color changer.
